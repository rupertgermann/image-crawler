# Image Crawler Project Status - 2025-05-16

## Implementation Overview

We've successfully implemented the key components of the image crawler application according to the implementation plan. The project now has a robust foundation with:

### Core Features
- **CLI Interface**: Enhanced with commander.js, supporting both local and web crawling modes with comprehensive options
- **Configuration Management**: Flexible configuration loading and saving with defaults
- **Local Crawling**: Directory scanning with filtering by size, dimensions, and file types
- **Web Crawling**: Google Images search with filtering and download capabilities
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Windows drive selection, macOS/Linux path handling
- **Human-Readable Sizes**: Added support for parsing sizes like '100KB', '1.5MB'

### Testing & Quality
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests for utilities (logger, config, paths, platform)
- **Integration Tests**: Tests for local and web crawlers
- **Test Utilities**: Custom utilities for file system, image generation, and console mocking
- **Coverage Enforcement**: Minimum 70% threshold for branches, functions, lines, and statements
- **Linting & Formatting**: ESLint with Prettier integration

### Documentation
- **Implementation Plan**: Updated with context7 best practices and explicit library recommendations
- **README**: Comprehensive usage examples and option descriptions
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed records of features implemented and issues resolved

## Current Status

The application is functional and implements all core features described in the implementation plan. We've enhanced the CLI interface to match the plan exactly, added human-readable file size parsing, and updated the documentation with comprehensive usage examples.

## Outstanding Issues

1. **Jest Configuration**: There are some ES modules compatibility issues with Jest that need to be resolved for the tests to run successfully.
2. **Test Coverage**: While we have comprehensive test files, we need to ensure they're running correctly and meeting the coverage thresholds.

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve Testing Issues**: Fix the Jest configuration to properly handle ES modules.
2. **Complete Test Coverage**: Ensure all components have adequate test coverage.
3. **Manual Testing**: Perform manual tests on different platforms to verify cross-platform functionality.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement batch processing and parallel downloads for better performance.
5. **Documentation Finalization**: Complete any remaining documentation, including troubleshooting guides.

## Conclusion

The Image Crawler project has made significant progress, with all core features implemented according to the plan. The remaining work focuses primarily on testing infrastructure and final polishing.
