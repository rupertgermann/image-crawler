# Image Crawler Project Status - 2025-05-17

## Implementation Overview

We've successfully implemented the key components of the image crawler application according to the implementation plan. The project now has a robust foundation with:

### Core Features
- **CLI Interface**: Enhanced with commander.js, supporting both local and web crawling modes with comprehensive options
- **Configuration Management**: Flexible configuration loading and saving with defaults
- **Local Crawling**: Directory scanning with filtering by size, dimensions, and file types
  - Added interactive folder selection for source directories
  - Implemented flat storage of images in the target folder
  - Added CLI-based folder selection fallback when native dialogs don't work
- **Web Crawling**: Google Images search with filtering and download capabilities
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Windows drive selection, macOS/Linux path handling
- **Human-Readable Sizes**: Added support for parsing sizes like '100KB', '1.5MB'

### Testing & Quality
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests for utilities (logger, config, paths, platform)
- **Integration Tests**: Tests for local and web crawlers
- **Test Utilities**: Custom utilities for file system, image generation, and console mocking
- **Coverage Enforcement**: Minimum 70% threshold for branches, functions, lines, and statements
- **Linting & Formatting**: ESLint with Prettier integration

### Documentation
- **Implementation Plan**: Updated with context7 best practices and explicit library recommendations
- **README**: Comprehensive usage examples and option descriptions
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed records of features implemented and issues resolved

## Current Status

The application is functional and implements all core features described in the implementation plan. We've enhanced the CLI interface to match the plan exactly, added human-readable file size parsing, and updated the documentation with comprehensive usage examples.

## Recent Improvements

1. **Max Downloads Limit**: Implemented correct max downloads limit behavior across all crawler sources:
   - Changed default max downloads from 100 to 50 in the config
   - Updated the PlaywrightCrawler to properly enforce the limit across multiple sources
   - Added better progress reporting during downloads
   - Fixed the interactive mode to use config values instead of hardcoded values
2. **Bug Fixes**: Fixed critical issues with undefined output directories in local mode by adding proper validation and fallbacks.
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error handling throughout the application with detailed logging and graceful fallbacks.
4. **Interactive UI**: Added both native and CLI-based folder selection interfaces for better user experience.
5. **Web Crawler Enhancement**: Replaced Puppeteer with Playwright for more reliable web crawling and implemented multi-source image crawling (Pixabay, Unsplash, Google Images).

## Outstanding Issues

1. **Jest Configuration**: There are some ES modules compatibility issues with Jest that need to be resolved for the tests to run successfully.
2. **Test Coverage**: While we have comprehensive test files, we need to ensure they're running correctly and meeting the coverage thresholds.

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve Testing Issues**: Fix the Jest configuration to properly handle ES modules.
2. **Complete Test Coverage**: Ensure all components have adequate test coverage.
3. **Manual Testing**: Perform manual tests on different platforms to verify cross-platform functionality.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement batch processing and parallel downloads for better performance.
5. **Documentation Finalization**: Complete any remaining documentation, including troubleshooting guides.
6. **Error Handling Review**: Continue to improve error handling and user feedback throughout the application.

## Conclusion

The Image Crawler project has made significant progress, with all core features implemented according to the plan. We've successfully fixed critical bugs related to output directory handling and enhanced the user experience with interactive folder selection. The remaining work focuses primarily on testing infrastructure and final polishing.
