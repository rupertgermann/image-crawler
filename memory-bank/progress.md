# Progress Update - Recent Cross-Platform Compatibility Analysis

## Objective:
Analyze and ensure the image_crawler application is compatible with macOS and Windows, focusing on path handling and default configurations.

## Implemented Features & Verifications:

1.  **Dynamic Default Paths:**
    *   Ensured `config.json` generation (via `src/utils/config.js`) uses dynamic, user-specific paths for default scan locations:
        *   Windows: `process.env.USERPROFILE + '\\Pictures'` (with fallback to `C:\\Pictures`)
        *   macOS: `$HOME/Pictures`
        *   Linux: `$HOME/Pictures`
    *   Fallbacks in `src/index.js` for source directory selection now consistently use `pathUtils.getDefaultScanDir()`, removing hardcoded `'C:\\\\'` for Windows.
2.  **Code Cleanup:**
    *   Removed the unused `normalizePath` function from `src/utils/platform.js` which had potentially problematic path separator logic.
3.  **Path Handling Best Practices:**
    *   Verified that path construction generally uses `path.join()` and `path.resolve()`, adhering to Node.js best practices for cross-platform path handling.
4.  **OS-Specific Logic Review:**
    *   Confirmed that `os.platform()` and `os.homedir()` (via `getPlatformInfo()`) are used appropriately for platform detection and user-specific directory access.
    *   Native dialog invocation in `src/utils/file-dialog.js` uses correct platform-specific commands (`osascript` for macOS, PowerShell for Windows) with a robust CLI fallback.
5.  **Dependency Review for Cross-Platform:**
    *   `cross-spawn`: Used for platform-independent child processes.
    *   `playwright`: Inherently cross-platform.
    *   `windows-drive-letters`: Handled as an optional dependency with a fallback mechanism for Windows drive detection.

## Encountered Errors & How We Fixed Them:

1.  **Hardcoded Windows User Path in Default Config:**
    *   **Issue:** The `DEFAULT_CONFIG` in `src/utils/config.js` initially used a hardcoded `defaultScanPath: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Pictures'` for Windows.
    *   **Fix:** Modified to use `process.env.USERPROFILE` to construct a dynamic path: `process.env.USERPROFILE ? path.join(process.env.USERPROFILE, 'Pictures') : 'C:\\\\Pictures'`.
2.  **Hardcoded Windows Fallback Path in CLI Logic:**
    *   **Issue:** `src/index.js` contained `'C:\\\\'` as a fallback source directory for Windows in some scenarios.
    *   **Fix:** Replaced these instances with `pathUtils.getDefaultScanDir()` to leverage the centralized and improved default path logic.
3.  **Unused/Potentially Problematic `normalizePath` Function:**
    *   **Issue:** `src/utils/platform.js` included an unused `normalizePath` function that inappropriately forced path separators.
    *   **Fix:** Removed the function to prevent potential future issues and clean up the codebase.

## Overall Assessment:
The application's architecture and use of Node.js core modules (`path`, `os`) and `fs-extra` are well-suited for cross-platform compatibility between macOS and Windows. The primary issues identified were related to hardcoded default paths specific to Windows, which have now been successfully refactored to use dynamic, user-specific locations. Further testing on distinct macOS and Windows environments is recommended to confirm these changes.

# Progress Update - 2025-05-18

## Latest Changes
- Fixed bug where maxDownloads could be 'undefined' or NaN in web mode and logs by ensuring both index.js and PlaywrightCrawler always set a valid number.
- Now, maxDownloads is always a number, using CLI input if valid or falling back to config/default (50).
- Prevents undefined/NaN values in logs and logic, ensuring robust, predictable behavior.

### Implemented Features
- Robust handling and validation of maxDownloads for web crawling mode.
- Defensive programming in both CLI setup and crawler constructor for consistent option passing.

### Encountered Errors
- Crawler and logs sometimes showed 'undefined' or NaN for download limits if the CLI option was omitted or invalid.

### How We Fixed It
- Added logic in index.js to always pass a valid number for maxDownloads to the crawler.
- Updated PlaywrightCrawler constructor to validate and default maxDownloads if needed.
- Confirmed via code review that logs and crawler logic now always use a valid number for this limit.

This update reflects the implementation of the image-crawler-implementation-plan.md, focusing on CLI enhancements, human-readable file size parsing, documentation improvements, and testing setup.

## Provider Refactoring Completed (Session Ending [Timestamp])

**Implemented Features:**
*   All image providers (Pexels, Google, Pixabay, Unsplash, Bing, Flickr, DuckDuckGo, FreeImages, Wikimedia) have been refactored to a new unified interface using `fetchImageUrls` and `getFullSizeImage`.
*   Providers now utilize the `PlaywrightCrawler`'s Playwright page instance instead of managing their own browser instances.
*   Legacy methods (`search`, `getImageUrls`, `downloadImages`) have been removed from all providers.
*   `initialize()` methods and `name` properties were added to all providers for consistency and logging.
*   Provider-specific configurations (e.g., `maxScrollsBing`, `scrollDelayDDG`) were added to `src/utils/config.js` for fine-tuning Bing, DuckDuckGo, and FreeImages behavior.

**Encountered Errors & Fixes:**
*   Initially attempted to use `write_to_file` for `progress.md` which failed as the file exists. Corrected by switching to `edit_file` for appending content (pending this action).

**Next Steps/Outstanding Issues:**
*   Thorough end-to-end testing of all refactored image providers with various search queries and configurations.
*   Update the main `README.md` to reflect any changes in provider configuration or usage, if necessary.
*   General code cleanup and review.

## Implemented Features
- Successfully configured the Electron main process (`electron/main.cjs`) to correctly load and use ES Modules (`.js` files) from the `src` directory.
- Implemented dynamic `import()` for `config.js`, `logger.js`, `local-crawler.js`, and `playwright-crawler.js` within `electron/main.cjs`.
- Wrapped the main process logic in an `async` Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to support `await` with dynamic imports.

## Encountered Errors and Fixes
1.  **Error:** `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` in `src/utils/config.cjs` and `src/utils/logger.cjs`.
    -   **Root Cause:** These files were renamed to `.cjs` but still contained `import` statements, causing Node.js to treat them as CommonJS files attempting to use ES Module syntax.
    -   **Fix:** Renamed `src/utils/config.cjs` back to `src/utils/config.js` and `src/utils/logger.cjs` back to `src/utils/logger.js`, restoring them to their original ES Module format.
2.  **Error:** `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` when `electron/main.cjs` attempted to `require` ES Modules like `local-crawler.js` and `playwright-crawler.js`.
    -   **Root Cause:** CommonJS modules cannot directly `require` ES Modules.
    -   **Fix:** Replaced `require()` calls with dynamic `await import()` for all ES Modules (`config.js`, `logger.js`, `local-crawler.js`, `playwright-crawler.js`) in `electron/main.cjs`.
3.  **Error:** Initial plan to convert `src` files to `.cjs` was incorrect based on user's clarification.
    -   **Root Cause:** Misinterpretation of user's intent to keep `src` files as ES Modules.
    -   **Fix:** Revised the plan to use dynamic imports in `electron/main.cjs` instead of converting `src` files.
4.  **Error:** `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/rupertgermann/AI/image_crawler/electron/preload.cjs'`
    -   **Root Cause:** The `preload.cjs` file was missing from the `electron` directory, but `electron/main.cjs` was still attempting to load it.
    -   **Fix:** Removed the `preload` script reference from `electron/main.cjs` to allow the application to launch without this dependency. Further investigation may be needed to determine if a preload script is functionally required.

## Commit Message
```
feat: Enable Electron main process to load ES Modules via dynamic import

- Reverted config.cjs and logger.cjs to their original .js (ES Module) extensions.
- Refactored electron/main.cjs to use dynamic await import() for all ES Modules
  (config.js, logger.js, local-crawler.js, playwright-crawler.js) from the src directory.
- Wrapped main process logic in an async IIFE to support asynchronous imports.
- Added try-catch blocks for robust error handling during module loading.
- Removed preload.cjs reference from main.cjs as the file was missing.
- Ensures Electron app correctly utilizes ES Modules without modifying src codebase.
```

# Progress Update - Test Framework Migration (Jest to Playwright Test) - 2025-05-23

## Implemented Features:

1.  **Testing Framework Migration**:
    *   Successfully initiated the migration from Jest to `@playwright/test` as the primary testing framework.
    *   **Rationale**: To leverage tighter integration with the existing Playwright usage for browser automation, better ES Module support, and a unified testing experience.
2.  **`package.json` Updates**:
    *   Modified `scripts.test` to `npx playwright test`.
    *   Removed Jest-specific scripts (e.g., `test:watch`, `test:coverage`).
    *   Removed Jest-related dependencies (`jest`, `@types/jest`, `@babel/core`, `@babel/preset-env`, `eslint-plugin-jest`, etc.) from `devDependencies`.
3.  **ESLint Configuration Update**:
    *   Modified `.eslintrc.js` to remove Jest-specific environment settings (`env.jest: true`) and plugin extensions (`plugin:jest/recommended`).
4.  **Test File Conversion**:
    *   Successfully converted `tests/test-provider-logging.test.js` from Jest syntax to `@playwright/test` syntax.
    *   Updated imports from `@jest/globals` to `@playwright/test`.
    *   Adapted test hooks (e.g., `beforeAll` to `test.beforeAll`).

## Encountered Errors & How We Fixed Them:

1.  **Finding ESLint Configuration**:
    *   **Issue**: Initial `find_by_name` calls failed to locate `.eslintrc.js` because it's a hidden file and the tool had difficulty with dotfile patterns.
    *   **Fix**: Directly used `view_file` with the common filename `.eslintrc.js`, which successfully retrieved its content.
2.  **Locating Test File**:
    *   **Issue**: An attempt to `view_file` for `tests/test-provider-logging.js` failed as the file did not exist under that exact name.
    *   **Fix**: Used `list_dir` on the `tests/` directory to identify the correct filename as `test-provider-logging.test.js`, which was then successfully viewed and edited.

## Next Steps:
- User to delete `jest.config.cjs`.
- User to run `npm install`.
- User to run `npm test` to execute tests with Playwright Test and verify the migration.

# Progress Update - Session: Migrating Remaining Unit Tests to Playwright (file-dialog, image-processor, logger)

## Objective:
Migrate remaining Jest unit tests to Playwright Test, handle missing source files, and prepare for a full test run.

## Key Features Modified/Tasks Completed:

1.  **`tests/unit/file-dialog.test.js` Conversion:**
    *   Successfully converted from Jest to Playwright Test.
    *   Manually mocked `child_process.exec` by replacing the module's function and restoring it in `beforeEach`/`afterEach`.
    *   Continued to mock `process.platform` by directly modifying `process.platform` and restoring it.

2.  **`tests/unit/image-processor.test.js` Handling:**
    *   Identified that the corresponding source file (`src/utils/image-processor.js`) was missing after multiple checks (`list_dir`, `find_by_name`).
    *   Based on user confirmation, deleted the orphaned test file `tests/unit/image-processor.test.js`.

3.  **`tests/unit/logger.test.js` Conversion:**
    *   Successfully converted from Jest to Playwright Test.
    *   Manually spied on `console` methods (log, error, warn, info, debug) by replacing them with custom spy functions and restoring originals in `beforeEach`/`afterEach`.

## Encountered Errors/Challenges & Fixes:

*   **Missing `image-processor.js` Source File:** The primary challenge was the missing source code for `image-processor.test.js`. This was resolved by confirming the file's absence and deleting the test upon user request.
*   **Tool Usage Error:** Incorrectly attempted to use `write_to_file` to append to `progress.md`, which failed as the file exists. This will be corrected by using `edit_file` for appending.

## Next Steps:

*   Run all Playwright tests using `npm test` to verify the complete migration of all test files.
*   Address any failures from the test run.
*   Update `project-status.md` at the end of the session.

## Progress Update (Header Action Buttons - Phase 1: UI Implementation)

**Implemented Features:**

1.  **Header Structure Update (`electron/index.html`):**
    *   Moved mode selection (`<input type="radio" name="mode">`) into the `header__left` div.
    *   Added a "Mode:" label (`<span class="header__mode-label">`) next to the app title.
    *   Added a unified "Start" button (`<button id="actionButton">`) and a "Stop" button (`<button id="stopButton">`) to the `header__actions` div.
    *   Removed the old, separate "Start Local Scan" and "Start Web Download" buttons from their respective option sections.

2.  **CSS Styling (`electron/css/styles.css`):**
    *   Adjusted `gap` in `.header__left` for a more compact layout.
    *   Added styles for `.header__mode-label` to ensure proper alignment and appearance.
    *   Leveraged existing button styles for the new header buttons.

3.  **Renderer Logic (`electron/renderer.js`):**
    *   Added references and event listeners for the new `actionButton` and `stopButton`.
    *   Implemented `updateVisibleOptions()` to dynamically change `actionButton` text ("Start Local Scan" / "Start Web Download") based on the selected mode and whether an operation is active.
    *   Centralized start logic: `actionButton` now triggers either local scan or web download based on the current mode.
    *   Implemented `stopButton` logic to call respective `stopLocalScan` or `stopWebDownload` IPC channels.
    *   Introduced a `currentOperation` variable to track whether a 'local' or 'web' task is running.
    *   Modified IPC event handlers (`setupLocalCrawlerEventListeners`, `setupWebCrawlerEventListeners`) to:
        *   Correctly update the state (enabled/disabled, text content) of the new `actionButton` and `stopButton`.
        *   Handle new `onScanStopped` and `onWebStopped` events to reset UI state after a stop command.

**Encountered Errors & Fixes:**
*   Initially, the `actionButton` text was not updating correctly when switching modes while an operation was running. This was fixed by ensuring the text only updates if `stopButton.disabled` is true (i.e., no operation active).
*   Ensured that IPC event handlers for completion, error, and stop events correctly reset the `currentOperation` state and update button texts/states via `updateVisibleOptions()`.

**Next Steps (based on current task):**
*   Verify and implement `stop()` methods in `LocalCrawler` and `WebCrawler` classes.
*   Ensure `main.cjs` correctly handles `stopLocalScan` and `stopWebDownload` IPC messages, calls the crawler `stop()` methods, and emits `scan-stopped` / `web-stopped` events back to the renderer.

---

# Progress Update - Backend for Header Action Buttons (Stop Functionality)

## Objective:
Implement the backend logic to support the new "Stop" button in the UI header, allowing users to cancel ongoing local scans and web downloads.

## Implemented Features:

1.  **IPC Channel Setup (`electron/preload.js`):**
    *   Added new IPC channels (`stopLocalScan`, `stopWebDownload`) to allow the renderer process to request a stop operation.
    *   Added event listeners (`onScanStopped`, `onWebStopped`) for the renderer to be notified when a scan/download has actually been stopped.
    *   Renamed existing event listeners (e.g., `onLocalCrawlerLog` to `onScanLog`) for consistency with `renderer.js`.
    *   Updated `removeAllListeners` functions to include the new and renamed events.

2.  **Main Process Handling (`electron/main.cjs`):**
    *   Introduced `activeLocalCrawler` and `activeWebCrawler` variables to keep track of the currently running crawler instances.
    *   Updated `START_LOCAL_SCAN` and `START_WEB_DOWNLOAD` IPC handlers to store the active crawler instance and clear it upon completion or error.
    *   Added checks to prevent starting a new scan/download if one of the same type is already in progress.
    *   Implemented new IPC handlers for `STOP_LOCAL_SCAN` and `STOP_WEB_DOWNLOAD`:
        *   These handlers call the `stop()` method on the respective active crawler instance.
        *   They send `'scan-stopped'` or `'web-stopped'` events back to the renderer upon successfully calling the stop method.
        *   They clear the reference to the active crawler.
    *   Ensured event names used for sending data to the renderer (logs, completion, errors) are consistent with `preload.js` and `renderer.js`.

3.  **Local Crawler Stop Logic (`src/modes/local-crawler.js`):**
    *   Added a `stopRequested` boolean flag, initialized to `false`.
    *   Implemented an `async stop()` method that sets `stopRequested = true` and emits a log.
    *   Integrated `if (this.stopRequested)` checks within recursive methods (`_estimateTotalFiles`, `scanDirectory`) and `processFile` to halt operations gracefully.
    *   The `start()` method now also checks this flag at various points for early exit.
    *   The final `complete` event summary now includes a `stoppedByUser` flag.

4.  **Web Crawler Stop Logic (`src/modes/playwright-crawler.js`):**
    *   Added a `stopRequested` boolean flag, initialized to `false`.
    *   Implemented an `async stop()` method that sets `stopRequested = true`, emits a log, and attempts to close the Playwright browser if active.
    *   Integrated `if (this.stopRequested)` checks within the main `start()` loop (before provider iteration, before image URL iteration) and at the beginning of `processImage()`.
    *   The `finally` block in `start()` ensures the browser is closed if it was opened, even if a stop was requested.
    *   The final `complete` event summary now includes a `stoppedByUser` flag.

## Encountered Errors & How We Fixed Them:

*   **Missing IPC Channels:** `preload.js` was missing the necessary functions and event listeners to handle stop requests and notifications. This was resolved by adding the required `ipcRenderer.invoke` calls and `ipcRenderer.on` listeners.
*   **Lack of Crawler Instance Management:** `main.cjs` did not track active crawler instances, making it impossible to call a `stop()` method. This was fixed by introducing `activeLocalCrawler` and `activeWebCrawler` variables and managing their lifecycle.
*   **No Stop Mechanism in Crawlers:** The `LocalCrawler` and `PlaywrightCrawler` classes lacked internal logic to interrupt their operations. This was addressed by adding a `stopRequested` flag and integrating checks for this flag throughout their processing loops, and by adding a specific `stop()` method to each.
*   **Event Name Inconsistencies:** Event names for logs, completion, and errors were inconsistent between `main.cjs`, `preload.js`, and `renderer.js`. These were standardized (e.g., `local-crawler-log` to `scan-log`).

## Overall Assessment:
The backend functionality for stopping both local scans and web downloads is now fully implemented. The changes ensure that stop requests from the UI are correctly processed, ongoing operations are halted as gracefully as possible, and the UI is notified of the outcome.

# Bug Fix - Web Mode Output Directory Selector Not Working

## Issue:
The "Select Output" button in the "Web Mode Options" section of the UI was not functional. Clicking it did not open a directory selection dialog.

## Root Cause:
While the button element (`selectWebOutputDirBtn`) existed in `electron/index.html`, the corresponding JavaScript event listener in `electron/renderer.js` to handle its click event was missing.

## Fix Implemented:

1.  **`electron/renderer.js`:**
    *   Added an event listener for the `selectWebOutputDirBtn` element.
    *   This listener, when the button is clicked, now calls `window.electronAPI.selectDirectory('Select Web Output Directory')`.
    *   If a directory is successfully selected, the `value` of the `webOutputDirInput` text field is updated with the chosen path.
    *   Log messages are generated for successful selection or any errors during the process.

## Overall Assessment:
The web mode output directory selector button is now functional, allowing users to choose a custom output location for their web downloads via the UI.
