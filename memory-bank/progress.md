# Progress Update - 2025-05-18

## Latest Changes
- Fixed bug where maxDownloads could be 'undefined' or NaN in web mode and logs by ensuring both index.js and PlaywrightCrawler always set a valid number.
- Now, maxDownloads is always a number, using CLI input if valid or falling back to config/default (50).
- Prevents undefined/NaN values in logs and logic, ensuring robust, predictable behavior.

### Implemented Features
- Robust handling and validation of maxDownloads for web crawling mode.
- Defensive programming in both CLI setup and crawler constructor for consistent option passing.

### Encountered Errors
- Crawler and logs sometimes showed 'undefined' or NaN for download limits if the CLI option was omitted or invalid.

### How We Fixed It
- Added logic in index.js to always pass a valid number for maxDownloads to the crawler.
- Updated PlaywrightCrawler constructor to validate and default maxDownloads if needed.
- Confirmed via code review that logs and crawler logic now always use a valid number for this limit.

# Progress Update - 2025-05-17

## Latest Changes
- Fixed max downloads/files limit behavior in both web and local modes
- Created a totalDownloadLimit property in PlaywrightCrawler to enforce a strict limit across all sources
- Updated LocalCrawler to properly respect the max files limit and stop scanning once the limit is reached
- Added tracking of processed vs. copied files in local mode for better reporting
- Added --max-downloads as an alias for --max-files in local mode for consistency
- Changed default max downloads from 100 to 50 in the config
- Updated interactive mode to use config values instead of hardcoded values
- Added better progress reporting during downloads with a centralized trackProgress utility
- Improved final reporting to show downloads per source and overall status
- Updated README to document the new options and behavior

# Progress Update - 2025-05-16

## Latest Changes
- Changed the default folder selection method from native dialogs to CLI interface
- Updated README to document environment variables and their usage
- Made the application more consistent across different environments
- Eliminated potential issues with native dialogs that might not be available in all contexts
- Enhanced web mode with better logging and validation similar to local mode
- Improved error handling and reporting in web mode
- Ensured proper validation of output directories in both modes
- Replaced Puppeteer with Playwright for web crawling to improve reliability
- Implemented multi-source image crawling (Pixabay, Unsplash, Google Images)
- Added more robust image extraction and filtering capabilities

## Features Implemented
- Comprehensive automated testing setup using Jest (unit and integration tests)
- Custom test utilities for file system, image generation, and console mocking
- Mocking for fs-extra, fs, and puppeteer to isolate tests
- Coverage enforcement (minimum 70%) and reporting (text, lcov, HTML)
- ESLint and Prettier integration for linting and formatting
- Developer scripts for running all tests, unit/integration tests, and coverage
- Husky/lint-staged pre-commit hook support
- Improved error handling and reporting in both code and documentation
- Expanded documentation on testing strategy and developer workflow
- Added human-readable file size parsing (e.g., '100KB', '1.5MB')
- Enhanced CLI options to match implementation plan exactly
- Updated README with comprehensive usage examples and option descriptions
- Added context7-recommended best practices to implementation plan
- Implemented interactive folder selection for source directories
- Added CLI-based folder selection fallback for when native dialogs don't work
- Enhanced config system to use default output directories

## Errors Encountered and Fixes
- Linting errors in package.json (fixed trailing commas)
- Directory creation errors for test/mocks/utils (resolved by creating directories before file writes)
- Timeout/context deadline errors when editing large test files (mitigated by breaking up edits)
- Fixed undefined output directory error in local mode by:
  - Adding proper validation and fallbacks in the getDefaultDownloadDir function
  - Ensuring the config system always returns valid paths
  - Adding safeguards in the LocalCrawler class to handle undefined directories
  - Implementing detailed logging to help diagnose path resolution issues
- Jest configuration conflicts between package.json and jest.config.js (resolved by using a single config file)
- ES modules compatibility issues with Jest (addressed by updating configuration files)

## How Errors Were Fixed
- Ensured all directories exist before writing files
- Carefully reviewed and applied file edits in smaller chunks when necessary
- Used robust mocking and test utility patterns to isolate and test edge cases
- Renamed configuration files to use appropriate extensions (.cjs) for CommonJS modules
- Updated package.json scripts to explicitly reference the Jest configuration file

This update reflects the implementation of the image-crawler-implementation-plan.md, focusing on CLI enhancements, human-readable file size parsing, documentation improvements, and testing setup.

## Provider Refactoring Completed (Session Ending [Timestamp])

**Implemented Features:**
*   All image providers (Pexels, Google, Pixabay, Unsplash, Bing, Flickr, DuckDuckGo, FreeImages, Wikimedia) have been refactored to a new unified interface using `fetchImageUrls` and `getFullSizeImage`.
*   Providers now utilize the `PlaywrightCrawler`'s Playwright page instance instead of managing their own browser instances.
*   Legacy methods (`search`, `getImageUrls`, `downloadImages`) have been removed from all providers.
*   `initialize()` methods and `name` properties were added to all providers for consistency and logging.
*   Provider-specific configurations (e.g., `maxScrollsBing`, `scrollDelayDDG`) were added to `src/utils/config.js` for fine-tuning Bing, DuckDuckGo, and FreeImages behavior.

**Encountered Errors & Fixes:**
*   Initially attempted to use `write_to_file` for `progress.md` which failed as the file exists. Corrected by switching to `edit_file` for appending content (pending this action).

**Next Steps/Outstanding Issues:**
*   Thorough end-to-end testing of all refactored image providers with various search queries and configurations.
*   Update the main `README.md` to reflect any changes in provider configuration or usage, if necessary.
*   General code cleanup and review.
