# Progress Summary - Image Crawler Project

## Adobe Stock Image Download Fix - Part 1: Update Playwright Config (2024-07-29)

**Objective**: Resolve the issue of invalid URLs when downloading images from Adobe Stock by updating the Playwright configuration.

**Implemented Features**:
- Updated `src/providers/configs/playwright/adobestock.js`:
    - Changed `fullSizeActions.selectors` from `['#details-enlarged-image']` to `['source[data-t=\"details-thumbnail-jpeg\"]']`.
    - Changed `fullSizeActions.attribute` from `'src'` to `'srcset'`.
- This targets the correct HTML element and attribute for the full-size image URL.

**Encountered Errors & How We Fixed Them**:
- The `write_to_file` tool failed to update `progress.md` because the file already exists. The plan is to use `replace_file_content` to insert the new progress.

**Next Steps**:
- Test the Adobe Stock provider thoroughly to ensure images are downloaded correctly.

## Adobe Stock Image Download Fix - Part 4: Robustness in `getFullSizeImage` (2024-07-29)

**Objective**: Ensure `AdobeStockProvider.getFullSizeImage` (scraping mode) robustly handles return values from `GenericPlaywrightProvider` and only returns a string URL or `null`, preventing `[object Object]` errors.

**Implemented Features**:
- Modified `src/providers/adobestock-provider.js` in the `getFullSizeImage` method (scraping mode):
    - Added explicit type checking for the URL returned by `genericProvider.getFullSizeImage()`.
    - If a non-empty string is received, it's returned.
    - If `null` is received, it's passed through.
    - If any other type (e.g., an object) or an empty string is received, a warning is logged with details, and `null` is returned.
- This change aims to prevent `[object Object]` from being processed by the download utility.

**Encountered Errors & How We Fixed Them**:
- **Issue**: Logs showed `Skipping invalid URL from AdobeStock: [object Object]`, indicating `getFullSizeImage` was returning an object instead of a string URL or `null`.
- **Root Cause**: The value returned by `GenericPlaywrightProvider.getFullSizeImage` was not strictly a string or `null` in all cases, and `AdobeStockProvider` was passing this value through.
- **Fix**: Added stricter type checking in `AdobeStockProvider.getFullSizeImage` to ensure it only returns a valid string URL or `null`.

**Next Steps**:
- Test the Adobe Stock provider again. If images are still not downloaded, examine the new warning logs from `getFullSizeImage` to understand what `GenericPlaywrightProvider` is returning, which will help pinpoint the issue within `GenericPlaywrightProvider` or the Playwright configuration itself.

# Progress Update - Recent Cross-Platform Compatibility Analysis

## Objective:
Analyze and ensure the image_crawler application is compatible with macOS and Windows, focusing on path handling and default configurations.

## Implemented Features & Verifications:

1.  **Dynamic Default Paths:**
    *   Ensured `config.json` generation (via `src/utils/config.js`) uses dynamic, user-specific paths for default scan locations:
        *   Windows: `process.env.USERPROFILE + '\\Pictures'` (with fallback to `C:\\Pictures`)
        *   macOS: `$HOME/Pictures`
        *   Linux: `$HOME/Pictures`
    *   Fallbacks in `src/index.js` for source directory selection now consistently use `pathUtils.getDefaultScanDir()`, removing hardcoded `'C:\\\\'` for Windows.
2.  **Code Cleanup:**
    *   Removed the unused `normalizePath` function from `src/utils/platform.js` which had potentially problematic path separator logic.
3.  **Path Handling Best Practices:**
    *   Verified that path construction generally uses `path.join()` and `path.resolve()`, adhering to Node.js best practices for cross-platform path handling.
4.  **OS-Specific Logic Review:**
    *   Confirmed that `os.platform()` and `os.homedir()` (via `getPlatformInfo()`) are used appropriately for platform detection and user-specific directory access.
    *   Native dialog invocation in `src/utils/file-dialog.js` uses correct platform-specific commands (`osascript` for macOS, PowerShell for Windows) with a robust CLI fallback.
5.  **Dependency Review for Cross-Platform:**
    *   `cross-spawn`: Used for platform-independent child processes.
    *   `playwright`: Inherently cross-platform.
    *   `windows-drive-letters`: Handled as an optional dependency with a fallback mechanism for Windows drive detection.

## Encountered Errors & How We Fixed Them:

1.  **Hardcoded Windows User Path in Default Config:**
    *   **Issue:** The `DEFAULT_CONFIG` in `src/utils/config.js` initially used a hardcoded `defaultScanPath: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Pictures'` for Windows.
    *   **Fix:** Modified to use `process.env.USERPROFILE` to construct a dynamic path: `process.env.USERPROFILE ? path.join(process.env.USERPROFILE, 'Pictures') : 'C:\\\\Pictures'`.
2.  **Hardcoded Windows Fallback Path in CLI Logic:**
    *   **Issue:** `src/index.js` contained `'C:\\\\'` as a fallback source directory for Windows in some scenarios.
    *   **Fix:** Replaced these instances with `pathUtils.getDefaultScanDir()` to leverage the centralized and improved default path logic.
3.  **Unused/Potentially Problematic `normalizePath` Function:**
    *   **Issue:** `src/utils/platform.js` included an unused `normalizePath` function that inappropriately forced path separators.
    *   **Fix:** Removed the function to prevent potential future issues and clean up the codebase.

## Overall Assessment:
The application's architecture and use of Node.js core modules (`path`, `os`) and `fs-extra` are well-suited for cross-platform compatibility between macOS and Windows. The primary issues identified were related to hardcoded default paths specific to Windows, which have now been successfully refactored to use dynamic, user-specific locations. Further testing on distinct macOS and Windows environments is recommended to confirm these changes.

---

This update reflects the implementation of the image-crawler-implementation-plan.md, focusing on CLI enhancements, human-readable file size parsing, documentation improvements, and testing setup.

## Provider Refactoring Completed (Session Ending [Timestamp])

**Implemented Features:**
*   All image providers (Pexels, Google, Pixabay, Unsplash, Bing, Flickr, DuckDuckGo, FreeImages, Wikimedia) have been refactored to a new unified interface using `fetchImageUrls` and `getFullSizeImage`.
*   Providers now utilize the `PlaywrightCrawler`'s Playwright page instance instead of managing their own browser instances.
*   Legacy methods (`search`, `getImageUrls`, `downloadImages`) have been removed from all providers.
*   `initialize()` methods and `name` properties were added to all providers for consistency and logging.
*   Provider-specific configurations (e.g., `maxScrollsBing`, `scrollDelayDDG`) were added to `src/utils/config.js` for fine-tuning Bing, DuckDuckGo, and FreeImages behavior.

**Encountered Errors & Fixes:**
*   Initially attempted to use `write_to_file` for `progress.md` which failed as the file exists. 

**Next Steps/Outstanding Issues:**
*   Thorough end-to-end testing of all refactored image providers with various search queries and configurations.
*   Update the main `README.md` to reflect any changes in provider configuration or usage, if necessary.
*   General code cleanup and review.

## Implemented Features
- Successfully configured the Electron main process (`electron/main.cjs`) to correctly load and use ES Modules (`.js` files) from the `src` directory.
- Implemented dynamic `import()` for `config.js`, `logger.js`, `local-crawler.js`, and `playwright-crawler.js` within `electron/main.cjs`.
- Wrapped the main process logic in an `async` Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to support `await` with dynamic imports.

## Encountered Errors and Fixes
1.  **Error:** `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` in `src/utils/config.cjs` and `src/utils/logger.cjs`.
    -   **Root Cause:** These files were renamed to `.cjs` but still contained `import` statements, causing Node.js to treat them as CommonJS files attempting to use ES Module syntax.
    -   **Fix:** Renamed `src/utils/config.cjs` back to `src/utils/config.js` and `src/utils/logger.cjs` back to `src/utils/logger.js`, restoring them to their original ES Module format.
2.  **Error:** `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` when `electron/main.cjs` attempted to `require` ES Modules like `local-crawler.js` and `playwright-crawler.js`.
    -   **Root Cause:** CommonJS modules cannot directly `require` ES Modules.
    -   **Fix:** Replaced `require()` calls with dynamic `await import()` for all ES Modules (`config.js`, `logger.js`, `local-crawler.js`, `playwright-crawler.js`) in `electron/main.cjs`.
3.  **Error:** Initial plan to convert `src` files to `.cjs` was incorrect based on user's clarification.
    -   **Root Cause:** Misinterpretation of user's intent to keep `src` files as ES Modules.
    -   **Fix:** Revised the plan to use dynamic imports in `electron/main.cjs` instead of converting `src` files.
4.  **Error:** `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/rupertgermann/AI/image_crawler/electron/preload.cjs'`
    -   **Root Cause:** The `preload.cjs` file was missing from the `electron` directory, but `electron/main.cjs` was still attempting to load it.
    -   **Fix:** Removed the `preload` script reference from `electron/main.cjs` to allow the application to launch without this dependency. Further investigation may be needed to determine if a preload script is functionally required.

## Commit Message
```
feat: Enable Electron main process to load ES Modules via dynamic import

- Reverted config.cjs and logger.cjs to their original .js (ES Module) extensions.
- Refactored electron/main.cjs to use dynamic await import() for all ES Modules
  (config.js, logger.js, local-crawler.js, playwright-crawler.js) from the src directory.
- Wrapped main process logic in an async IIFE to support asynchronous imports.
- Added try-catch blocks for robust error handling during module loading.
- Removed preload.cjs reference from main.cjs as the file was missing.
- Ensures Electron app correctly utilizes ES Modules without modifying src codebase.

```

# UI Enhancement - Improved Visibility for Secondary Buttons

## Objective:
To enhance the visibility of secondary action buttons (e.g., "Select Source", "Select Output") in the UI, making them easier to distinguish from the background.

## Changes Implemented in `electron/css/styles.css`:

1.  **`.button--secondary` Styling**:
    *   `background-color`: Changed from `var(--bg-secondary)` to `var(--accent-color)`.
    *   `color`: Changed from `var(--text-primary)` to `var(--bg-primary)`.
    *   `border`: Set to `1px solid var(--accent-color)` to match the new background.

2.  **`.button--secondary:hover` Styling**:
    *   `background-color`: Changed to `var(--accent-hover)`.
    *   `border-color`: Changed to `var(--accent-hover)`.

3.  **General `.button` Styling Simplification**:
    *   Removed `transform` and `box-shadow` from general button hover states.
    *   Simplified disabled state to primarily use `opacity`.

## Overall Assessment:
The secondary buttons are now significantly more visible, using the accent color for their background and a contrasting text color. This improves the overall usability and aesthetic of the application by making key interactive elements more prominent.

---

# UI Improvement - Remove Local Scan Completion Dialogs

## Objective:
To remove the disruptive `alert` dialogs that appear upon the completion or stopping of a local scan, while ensuring the information is still available in the log area.

## Changes Implemented in `electron/renderer.js`:

1.  **`window.electronAPI.onScanComplete` Handler**:
    *   The `alert` call displaying the scan summary upon completion has been commented out.

2.  **`window.electronAPI.onScanStopped` Handler**:
    *   The `alert` call confirming the scan has been stopped has been commented out.

3.  **`window.electronAPI.onWebComplete` Handler**:
    *   The `alert` call for web download completion remains active, as its removal was not requested.

## Overall Assessment:
The application now provides a less intrusive user experience during local scan operations by removing pop-up alerts. Users can still review scan status and summaries within the integrated log area.

---

# Bug Fix - Web Mode Start Button Not Functioning

## Issue Description:
After a previous fix for a `TypeError` related to missing checkboxes (`webSafeSearchCheckbox`, `webHeadlessCheckbox`), the web mode start button stopped initiating downloads, although no console errors were present. This was due to the accidental removal of the core logic for preparing options and calling `startWebDownload`.

## Changes Implemented in `electron/renderer.js`:

1.  **Restored Web Download Logic**:
    *   The block of code within the `actionButton`'s click event listener, specifically for `selectedMode === 'web'`, has been fully restored. This includes:
        *   Creation of the `options` object for `startWebDownload`, ensuring the null checks for `webSafeSearchCheckbox` and `webHeadlessCheckbox` (defaulting to `true` if elements are missing) are correctly integrated.
        *   The `logMessage` call for the options.
        *   The call to `setupWebCrawlerEventListeners`.
        *   The `await window.electronAPI.startWebDownload(options);` call.
        *   The associated `try...catch` block for error handling.

2.  **Added Return After Alert**:
    *   A `return;` statement was added after the `alert` that notifies the user if the 'Search query' or 'Output directory' is missing. This ensures the function exits immediately after the alert, preventing further execution with invalid inputs.

## User Preference:
*   The user explicitly requested to only remove the completion alert. Alerts for web download errors (`onWebError`) and manual stops (`onWebStopped`) were intentionally kept.

## Overall Assessment:
The web mode start button functionality has been fully restored. The fix ensures that the correct logic is executed when the button is clicked, while also maintaining resilience against missing optional UI elements (checkboxes).

    *   Renamed "Automatic Installation (Recommended)" to "**For CLI Usage (Global Install)**".
    *   Added a new subsection: "**For Electron GUI Usage (Running from Source/Development)**" with detailed steps:
        *   `git clone https://github.com/rupertgermann/image-crawler.git`
        *   `cd image-crawler`
        *   `npm install`
        *   `npx playwright install --with-deps` (to ensure browsers are available for Electron)
        *   `npm run electron:start` (confirmed from `package.json`)

4.  **Usage Section Updated**:
    *   Added an introductory sentence stating the app can be used via CLI or GUI.
    *   Added a new subsection: "**Electron GUI Mode**" explaining how to launch it (`npm run electron:start`) and briefly describing UI interaction (mode selection, options, start/stop, log area, themes).
    *   Renamed the existing interactive mode section to "**CLI Mode**".

5.  **General Enhancements**:
    *   Updated the "Why Image Crawler?" section to mention both CLI and GUI.
    *   Ensured all existing CLI examples, options, and troubleshooting information were preserved.

## Overall Assessment:
The `README.md` now accurately reflects the project's capabilities, especially highlighting the Electron GUI. The inclusion of screenshots and clear instructions for both CLI and GUI usage significantly improves the documentation's quality and usefulness for new users and developers.

# Progress Update - Flickr API Key Configuration (2025-05-24)

## Implemented Features:
- **Flickr API Key Configuration**: Added the ability to configure the Flickr API key.
  - The API key can be set in `config.json` under `providers.flickr.apiKey`.
  - Alternatively, it can be set using the `FLICKR_API_KEY` environment variable.
  - Updated `config.json` to include the `providers.flickr.apiKey` field with a placeholder value `"YOUR_FLICKR_API_KEY_HERE"`.
  - The `src/providers/flickr-provider.js` reads this key from the merged configuration object or falls back to the environment variable.

## Encountered Errors:
- Initially attempted to use `write_to_file` to update `progress.md`, which failed because the file already exists. 

## How Errors Were Fixed:
- Corrected the approach to use `edit_file` with an append instruction after viewing the existing file content to ensure proper formatting and placement of the new entry.

---

# Progress Update - Added `config.json.example` (2025-05-24)

## Implemented Features:
- **Created `config.json.example`**: Generated a comprehensive example configuration file named `config.json.example` based on the current `config.json`.
  - The example file uses generic user paths (e.g., `/Users/your_username/Pictures`, `/home/your_username/Pictures`).
  - It includes all current configuration options and placeholders for sensitive information like API keys (e.g., `YOUR_FLICKR_API_KEY_HERE`).
- **Updated `README.md`**: Modified the "Advanced Configuration" section in `README.md`.
  - Added a note explaining that `config.json.example` can be copied to `config.json` and customized by the user.

# Progress Update - Added New Providers: StockSnap.io & Shutterstock (Preview) (2025-05-24)

## Implemented Features:
- **New Provider: StockSnap.io (`stocksnap-provider.js`)**:
  - Implemented a provider to fetch free CC0 images from `StockSnap.io` using web scraping.
  - The provider navigates search results and detail pages to extract full-size image URLs.
- **New Provider: Shutterstock (`shutterstock-provider.js`)**:
  - Implemented a provider for `Shutterstock.com`.
  - Primarily uses web scraping to fetch watermarked preview images.
  - Includes a configuration option for an API key (`providers.shutterstock.apiKey`), with a note that full API download functionality is not yet implemented but the structure is ready for future extension. If no key is present, it defaults to preview scraping.
- **Configuration Updates (`config.json`, `config.json.example`)**:
  - Added `stocksnap` and `shutterstock` to the `providers.order` array.
  - Included new configuration sections for `stocksnap` (enabled, maxResults) and `shutterstock` (enabled, maxResults, apiKey placeholder).
- **Documentation Updates (`README.md`)**:
  - Updated the list of supported providers in the "Features" section and the dedicated "Supported Image Providers" section to include `StockSnap.io` and `Shutterstock` (noting its preview capability).
  - Updated the description of the `--provider` CLI option.
  - Corrected and enhanced the example `config.json` structure in the "Advanced Configuration" section to be more comprehensive and include examples for the new providers.

## Encountered Errors:
- The initial update to the example JSON block in `README.md` was overly aggressive and removed some existing examples. This was subsequently corrected.

## How Errors Were Fixed:
- A follow-up `edit_file` operation was performed on `README.md` to restore and enhance the example JSON block, ensuring it accurately reflected a comprehensive configuration including previously existing examples alongside the new ones.

# Progress Update - Provider Implementation Task List Created (2025-05-24)

## Implemented Features:
- **Created `docs/provider_implementation_tasks.md`**:
  - Generated a new markdown file containing a comprehensive task list for implementing the new image providers.
  - The task list is based on the `docs/new_provider_implementation_plan.md`.
  - It breaks down the implementation for each pending provider into actionable, checkable steps (e.g., create file, implement constructor, implement `fetchImageUrls`, update config, update README, test).
  - Providers are grouped similarly to the plan (those with detailed plans in Section 3, other API providers, other web scraping providers).
  - This file will serve as a checklist to track progress on implementing the new providers.

## Encountered Errors:
- No errors encountered in this step.

## How Errors Were Fixed:
- N/A.

## Project Status: IN DEVELOPMENT - REFACTORING & OPTIMIZATION

### Playwright Provider Refactoring (2025-05-24)
**Objective**: Consolidate multiple Playwright-based image providers into a single, generic, configurable provider to improve maintainability, reduce code duplication, and simplify the addition of new providers, while preserving all existing functionality.

**Implemented Features & Changes**:

1.  **Provider Consolidation & Configuration**:
    *   Successfully migrated the following 11 Playwright-based providers to use the `GenericPlaywrightProvider` with configurations in `src/providers/configs/provider-configs.js`:
        *   Google
        *   Bing
        *   Pixabay
        *   Unsplash
        *   DuckDuckGo
        *   FreeImages
        *   StockSnap
        *   FreeRangeStock
        *   PublicDomainPictures
        *   Reshot
        *   Shutterstock (Preview Mode)
    *   Each provider's specific logic (search URLs, selectors, scrolling strategy, image extraction methods, full-size image retrieval actions) is now defined declaratively in `provider-configs.js`.

2.  **Enhancements to `GenericPlaywrightProvider`**:
    *   Added support for `queryTransformations` (e.g., `toLowerCase`, `spacesToHyphens`) in the provider configuration to handle provider-specific search query formatting (e.g., for FreeRangeStock).
    *   Improved the `link_collection` image extraction type to correctly use `extractionConfig.baseUrl` for resolving relative URLs (e.g., for StockSnap, FreeRangeStock, PublicDomainPictures, Reshot).
    *   Refined filter application logic within `_extractImageUrlsFromPage`.
    *   The provider now handles various full-size image retrieval strategies based on configuration: `direct`, `attribute`, `url_param_decode`, `url_cleanup`, and `detail_page` (with support for multiple candidate selectors and attribute extraction).

3.  **Code Cleanup & Simplification**:
    *   Deleted 11 individual provider JavaScript files (`google-provider.js`, `bing-provider.js`, etc.) from `src/providers/` as their functionality is now covered by the generic provider and their respective configurations.
    *   Simplified `src/providers/provider-registry.js` by removing the redundant `switch` statement previously used to load these individual provider files. The registry now primarily relies on `PROVIDER_CONFIGS` for Playwright providers.

4.  **Preserved Functionality & Improved Maintainability**:
    *   All known functionalities of the refactored providers (search, thumbnail extraction, full-size image preview/download) are intended to be preserved.
    *   The new structure significantly improves maintainability and makes it easier to add or modify Playwright-based image sources by simply adding or editing a configuration object.

**Encountered Issues & Fixes During Refactoring**:

1.  **Relative URL Handling in `link_collection`**:
    *   **Issue**: The `link_collection` extraction type initially did not correctly resolve relative URLs for detail pages or thumbnails.
    *   **Fix**: Enhanced `_extractImageUrlsFromPage` to utilize `extractionConfig.baseUrl` when a `link_collection` type is used and an extracted URL is found to be relative.
2.  **Provider-Specific Query Formatting**:
    *   **Issue**: Some providers (e.g., FreeRangeStock) require specific formatting for search queries (e.g., lowercase, spaces to hyphens).
    *   **Fix**: Introduced the `queryTransformations` array in the provider configuration and updated `_constructSearchUrl` in `GenericPlaywrightProvider` to apply these transformations.
3.  **Complex Full-Size Image Selectors**:
    *   **Issue**: Some sites (e.g., Shutterstock preview) use multiple possible selectors for the main image on a detail page.
    *   **Fix**: The `detail_page` action in `fullSizeActions` now accepts an array of `selectors`, and the generic provider attempts them in order until an image is found. The `waitStrategy` was also adapted (e.g. `locator_any`).

**Next Steps (as per Refactoring Plan)**:

*   **Testing and Validation**: Conduct thorough unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for all refactored providers using the generic provider framework.
*   **Documentation**: Update all relevant project documentation (README, developer guides) to reflect the new provider architecture and explain how to add/configure new providers.
*   **Review and Refine**: Further review the `GenericPlaywrightProvider` and configurations for any additional optimization or generalization opportunities.

## Session 2025-05-24 (Refactoring Follow-up & Bug Fix)

**Implemented Features:**
- N/A (Focus on bug fixing from previous refactor)

**Encountered Errors & Fixes:**
1.  **Issue:** A warning `[Bing] Unknown full-size action type: lightbox` was observed.
    *   **Root Cause:** The `FULL_SIZE_ACTIONS` constant in `src/providers/generic-playwright-provider.js` was incorrectly mapping uppercase action type strings (e.g., `LIGHTBOX`) to lowercase string *values* (e.g., `'lightbox'`) instead of to the actual handler *functions* (e.g., the `lightbox` function). The `getFullSizeImage` method, which looks up actions using `actionConfig.type.toUpperCase()`, was therefore unable to find the correct handler.
    *   **Fix:** Modified `src/providers/generic-playwright-provider.js`:
        *   Redefined the `FULL_SIZE_ACTIONS` object to map uppercase action type strings directly to their respective handler function references (e.g., `LIGHTBOX: lightbox`).
        *   Ensured the handler functions (`direct`, `lightbox`, `detail_page`, `url_cleaning`, `url_param_decode`) are defined as standalone async functions that `FULL_SIZE_ACTIONS` can reference.
        *   Corrected the lookup in `getFullSizeImage` to use the `FULL_SIZE_ACTIONS` constant.
    *   **Result:** This change ensures that the `GenericPlaywrightProvider` can correctly dispatch to the configured `fullSizeAction` handlers, resolving the warning.

**Next Steps (if applicable based on current task):**
- Continue with testing and validation of the refactored Playwright providers.
- Update documentation for the new provider architecture.

## Refactor: Modularize Playwright Provider Configurations (Session ending YYYY-MM-DD)

**Implemented Features:**
*   Refactored Playwright provider configurations from a single `provider-configs.js` file into individual files per provider (e.g., `google.js`, `bing.js`) located in `src/providers/configs/playwright/`.
*   Updated `src/providers/provider-registry.js` to dynamically discover and load these individual configuration files at runtime.
*   Deleted the old, monolithic `provider-configs.js` file after confirming it was no longer referenced.

**Encountered Errors & Fixes:**
*   Introduced linting errors in `provider-registry.js` during the refactoring due to complex string manipulation for constructing file URLs.
*   Fixed the linting errors by simplifying the file URL construction using Node.js's built-in `pathToFileURL` function from the `url` module, which also improved code robustness and cross-platform compatibility.

**Next Steps (if applicable based on current task):**
*   The application should be tested to ensure all Playwright-based providers are correctly loaded and functional with the new configuration structure.

# Bugfix: Provider Selection and Bing Warning (Ongoing - YYYY-MM-DD)

**Objective**: Resolve issues where selected image provider is ignored and address Bing's full-size action type warning.

**Implemented Features (Part 1 - Provider Selection):**

*   **Provider Selection Override in `ConfigManager`:**
    *   Modified the `getConfig` method in `src/utils/config.js`.
    *   The method now correctly processes `this.cliProviderOverrides` (set by UI/CLI selection).
    *   If a single provider is selected (and not 'all'), the configuration returned to `ProviderRegistry` will have only that provider enabled. All other providers will be explicitly disabled.
    *   If 'all' providers are selected, the configuration ensures all known providers are enabled.
    *   This directly addresses the bug where the UI's provider selection was being ignored in web mode.

**Encountered Errors & Fixes:**

*   Initially attempted to use `write_to_file` for `progress.md` which failed as the file already exists. Corrected to view and then edit/append to the file.

**Next Steps:**

*   User to test the application thoroughly:
    *   Verify single provider selection works as expected in Web Mode (e.g., StockSnap, DuckDuckGo).
    *   Verify 'All Providers' selection activates multiple providers.
    *   Specifically test 'Bing' to check if the `Unknown full-size action type: lightbox` warning persists after this fix.
*   If the Bing warning is still present, further investigation will be needed as per the original plan (e.g., adding more logging around `FULL_SIZE_ACTIONS` in `generic-playwright-provider.js`).

**Implemented Features (Part 2 - Bing Warning Fix Attempt):**

*   **Uppercase Action Type for Lookup:**
    *   Identified that `actionConfig.type` (e.g., 'lightbox' from `bing.js`) was not being converted to uppercase before being used as a key for the `FULL_SIZE_ACTIONS` map in `src/providers/generic-playwright-provider.js` (which uses uppercase keys like 'LIGHTBOX').
    *   Modified the `getFullSizeImage` method to convert `actionConfig.type` to `actionConfig.type.toUpperCase()` before the lookup.
    *   This is intended to resolve the `[WARN]: [Bing] Unknown full-size action type: lightbox` warning.

**Next Steps:**

*   User to re-test with Bing to confirm the warning is resolved.
*   If the warning persists, add more detailed logging to `getFullSizeImage` to inspect `actionConfig`, the derived `actionType`, and the keys of `FULL_SIZE_ACTIONS` at runtime.
