# Progress Update - 2025-05-16

## Features Implemented
- Comprehensive automated testing setup using Jest (unit and integration tests)
- Custom test utilities for file system, image generation, and console mocking
- Mocking for fs-extra, fs, and puppeteer to isolate tests
- Coverage enforcement (minimum 70%) and reporting (text, lcov, HTML)
- ESLint and Prettier integration for linting and formatting
- Developer scripts for running all tests, unit/integration tests, and coverage
- Husky/lint-staged pre-commit hook support
- Improved error handling and reporting in both code and documentation
- Expanded documentation on testing strategy and developer workflow

## Errors Encountered and Fixes
- Linting errors in package.json (fixed trailing commas)
- Directory creation errors for test/mocks/utils (resolved by creating directories before file writes)
- Timeout/context deadline errors when editing large test files (mitigated by breaking up edits)

## How Errors Were Fixed
- Ensured all directories exist before writing files
- Carefully reviewed and applied file edits in smaller chunks when necessary
- Used robust mocking and test utility patterns to isolate and test edge cases

This update reflects the successful implementation of robust testing, workflow automation, and documentation improvements for the Image Crawler project.
