# Progress Update - Recent Cross-Platform Compatibility Analysis

## Objective:
Analyze and ensure the image_crawler application is compatible with macOS and Windows, focusing on path handling and default configurations.

## Implemented Features & Verifications:

1.  **Dynamic Default Paths:**
    *   Ensured `config.json` generation (via `src/utils/config.js`) uses dynamic, user-specific paths for default scan locations:
        *   Windows: `process.env.USERPROFILE + '\\Pictures'` (with fallback to `C:\\Pictures`)
        *   macOS: `$HOME/Pictures`
        *   Linux: `$HOME/Pictures`
    *   Fallbacks in `src/index.js` for source directory selection now consistently use `pathUtils.getDefaultScanDir()`, removing hardcoded `'C:\\\\'` for Windows.
2.  **Code Cleanup:**
    *   Removed the unused `normalizePath` function from `src/utils/platform.js` which had potentially problematic path separator logic.
3.  **Path Handling Best Practices:**
    *   Verified that path construction generally uses `path.join()` and `path.resolve()`, adhering to Node.js best practices for cross-platform path handling.
4.  **OS-Specific Logic Review:**
    *   Confirmed that `os.platform()` and `os.homedir()` (via `getPlatformInfo()`) are used appropriately for platform detection and user-specific directory access.
    *   Native dialog invocation in `src/utils/file-dialog.js` uses correct platform-specific commands (`osascript` for macOS, PowerShell for Windows) with a robust CLI fallback.
5.  **Dependency Review for Cross-Platform:**
    *   `cross-spawn`: Used for platform-independent child processes.
    *   `playwright`: Inherently cross-platform.
    *   `windows-drive-letters`: Handled as an optional dependency with a fallback mechanism for Windows drive detection.

## Encountered Errors & How We Fixed Them:

1.  **Hardcoded Windows User Path in Default Config:**
    *   **Issue:** The `DEFAULT_CONFIG` in `src/utils/config.js` initially used a hardcoded `defaultScanPath: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Pictures'` for Windows.
    *   **Fix:** Modified to use `process.env.USERPROFILE` to construct a dynamic path: `process.env.USERPROFILE ? path.join(process.env.USERPROFILE, 'Pictures') : 'C:\\\\Pictures'`.
2.  **Hardcoded Windows Fallback Path in CLI Logic:**
    *   **Issue:** `src/index.js` contained `'C:\\\\'` as a fallback source directory for Windows in some scenarios.
    *   **Fix:** Replaced these instances with `pathUtils.getDefaultScanDir()` to leverage the centralized and improved default path logic.
3.  **Unused/Potentially Problematic `normalizePath` Function:**
    *   **Issue:** `src/utils/platform.js` included an unused `normalizePath` function that inappropriately forced path separators.
    *   **Fix:** Removed the function to prevent potential future issues and clean up the codebase.

## Overall Assessment:
The application's architecture and use of Node.js core modules (`path`, `os`) and `fs-extra` are well-suited for cross-platform compatibility between macOS and Windows. The primary issues identified were related to hardcoded default paths specific to Windows, which have now been successfully refactored to use dynamic, user-specific locations. Further testing on distinct macOS and Windows environments is recommended to confirm these changes.

# Progress Update - 2025-05-18

## Latest Changes
- Fixed bug where maxDownloads could be 'undefined' or NaN in web mode and logs by ensuring both index.js and PlaywrightCrawler always set a valid number.
- Now, maxDownloads is always a number, using CLI input if valid or falling back to config/default (50).
- Prevents undefined/NaN values in logs and logic, ensuring robust, predictable behavior.

### Implemented Features
- Robust handling and validation of maxDownloads for web crawling mode.
- Defensive programming in both CLI setup and crawler constructor for consistent option passing.

### Encountered Errors

This update reflects the implementation of the image-crawler-implementation-plan.md, focusing on CLI enhancements, human-readable file size parsing, documentation improvements, and testing setup.

## Provider Refactoring Completed (Session Ending [Timestamp])

**Implemented Features:**
*   All image providers (Pexels, Google, Pixabay, Unsplash, Bing, Flickr, DuckDuckGo, FreeImages, Wikimedia) have been refactored to a new unified interface using `fetchImageUrls` and `getFullSizeImage`.
*   Providers now utilize the `PlaywrightCrawler`'s Playwright page instance instead of managing their own browser instances.
*   Legacy methods (`search`, `getImageUrls`, `downloadImages`) have been removed from all providers.
*   `initialize()` methods and `name` properties were added to all providers for consistency and logging.
*   Provider-specific configurations (e.g., `maxScrollsBing`, `scrollDelayDDG`) were added to `src/utils/config.js` for fine-tuning Bing, DuckDuckGo, and FreeImages behavior.

**Encountered Errors & Fixes:**
*   Initially attempted to use `write_to_file` for `progress.md` which failed as the file exists. Corrected by switching to `edit_file` for appending content (pending this action).

**Next Steps/Outstanding Issues:**
*   Thorough end-to-end testing of all refactored image providers with various search queries and configurations.
*   Update the main `README.md` to reflect any changes in provider configuration or usage, if necessary.
*   General code cleanup and review.

## Implemented Features
- Successfully configured the Electron main process (`electron/main.cjs`) to correctly load and use ES Modules (`.js` files) from the `src` directory.
- Implemented dynamic `import()` for `config.js`, `logger.js`, `local-crawler.js`, and `playwright-crawler.js` within `electron/main.cjs`.
- Wrapped the main process logic in an `async` Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to support `await` with dynamic imports.

## Encountered Errors and Fixes
1.  **Error:** `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` in `src/utils/config.cjs` and `src/utils/logger.cjs`.
    -   **Root Cause:** These files were renamed to `.cjs` but still contained `import` statements, causing Node.js to treat them as CommonJS files attempting to use ES Module syntax.
    -   **Fix:** Renamed `src/utils/config.cjs` back to `src/utils/config.js` and `src/utils/logger.cjs` back to `src/utils/logger.js`, restoring them to their original ES Module format.
2.  **Error:** `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` when `electron/main.cjs` attempted to `require` ES Modules like `local-crawler.js` and `playwright-crawler.js`.
    -   **Root Cause:** CommonJS modules cannot directly `require` ES Modules.
    -   **Fix:** Replaced `require()` calls with dynamic `await import()` for all ES Modules (`config.js`, `logger.js`, `local-crawler.js`, `playwright-crawler.js`) in `electron/main.cjs`.
3.  **Error:** Initial plan to convert `src` files to `.cjs` was incorrect based on user's clarification.
    -   **Root Cause:** Misinterpretation of user's intent to keep `src` files as ES Modules.
    -   **Fix:** Revised the plan to use dynamic imports in `electron/main.cjs` instead of converting `src` files.
4.  **Error:** `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/rupertgermann/AI/image_crawler/electron/preload.cjs'`
    -   **Root Cause:** The `preload.cjs` file was missing from the `electron` directory, but `electron/main.cjs` was still attempting to load it.
    -   **Fix:** Removed the `preload` script reference from `electron/main.cjs` to allow the application to launch without this dependency. Further investigation may be needed to determine if a preload script is functionally required.

## Commit Message
```
feat: Enable Electron main process to load ES Modules via dynamic import

- Reverted config.cjs and logger.cjs to their original .js (ES Module) extensions.
- Refactored electron/main.cjs to use dynamic await import() for all ES Modules
  (config.js, logger.js, local-crawler.js, playwright-crawler.js) from the src directory.
- Wrapped main process logic in an async IIFE to support asynchronous imports.
- Added try-catch blocks for robust error handling during module loading.
- Removed preload.cjs reference from main.cjs as the file was missing.
- Ensures Electron app correctly utilizes ES Modules without modifying src codebase.

```

# UI Enhancement - Improved Visibility for Secondary Buttons

## Objective:
To enhance the visibility of secondary action buttons (e.g., "Select Source", "Select Output") in the UI, making them easier to distinguish from the background.

## Changes Implemented in `electron/css/styles.css`:

1.  **`.button--secondary` Styling**:
    *   `background-color`: Changed from `var(--bg-secondary)` to `var(--accent-color)`.
    *   `color`: Changed from `var(--text-primary)` to `var(--bg-primary)`.
    *   `border`: Set to `1px solid var(--accent-color)` to match the new background.

2.  **`.button--secondary:hover` Styling**:
    *   `background-color`: Changed to `var(--accent-hover)`.
    *   `border-color`: Changed to `var(--accent-hover)`.

3.  **General `.button` Styling Simplification**:
    *   Removed `transform` and `box-shadow` from general button hover states.
    *   Simplified disabled state to primarily use `opacity`.

## Overall Assessment:
The secondary buttons are now significantly more visible, using the accent color for their background and a contrasting text color. This improves the overall usability and aesthetic of the application by making key interactive elements more prominent.

---

# UI Improvement - Remove Local Scan Completion Dialogs

## Objective:
To remove the disruptive `alert` dialogs that appear upon the completion or stopping of a local scan, while ensuring the information is still available in the log area.

## Changes Implemented in `electron/renderer.js`:

1.  **`window.electronAPI.onScanComplete` Handler**:
    *   The `alert` call displaying the scan summary upon completion has been commented out.

2.  **`window.electronAPI.onScanStopped` Handler**:
    *   The `alert` call confirming the scan has been stopped has been commented out.

3.  **`window.electronAPI.onWebComplete` Handler**:
    *   The `alert` call for web download completion remains active, as its removal was not requested.

## Overall Assessment:
The application now provides a less intrusive user experience during local scan operations by removing pop-up alerts. Users can still review scan status and summaries within the integrated log area.

---

# Bug Fix - Web Mode Start Button Not Functioning

## Issue Description:
After a previous fix for a `TypeError` related to missing checkboxes (`webSafeSearchCheckbox`, `webHeadlessCheckbox`), the web mode start button stopped initiating downloads, although no console errors were present. This was due to the accidental removal of the core logic for preparing options and calling `startWebDownload`.

## Changes Implemented in `electron/renderer.js`:

1.  **Restored Web Download Logic**:
    *   The block of code within the `actionButton`'s click event listener, specifically for `selectedMode === 'web'`, has been fully restored. This includes:
        *   Creation of the `options` object for `startWebDownload`, ensuring the null checks for `webSafeSearchCheckbox` and `webHeadlessCheckbox` (defaulting to `true` if elements are missing) are correctly integrated.
        *   The `logMessage` call for the options.
        *   The call to `setupWebCrawlerEventListeners`.
        *   The `await window.electronAPI.startWebDownload(options);` call.
        *   The associated `try...catch` block for error handling.

2.  **Added Return After Alert**:
    *   A `return;` statement was added after the `alert` that notifies the user if the 'Search query' or 'Output directory' is missing. This ensures the function exits immediately after the alert, preventing further execution with invalid inputs.

## Overall Assessment:
The web mode start button functionality has been fully restored. The fix ensures that the correct logic is executed when the button is clicked, while also maintaining resilience against missing optional UI elements (checkboxes).

---

# Feature: Clear Log Button

## Objective:
Provide users with a button to easily clear all messages from the log display area in the UI.

## Implementation Details:

1.  **`electron/index.html` Modifications:**
    *   Ensured the log display area (`<div id="logArea">`) and its associated controls are housed within a dedicated global `<section class="section">` for Logs, separate from mode-specific options.
    *   Added a new button element:
        ```html
        <button id="clearUiLogsBtn" class="button button--secondary">Clear Logs</button>
        ```
        This button was placed within the `div` (class `mt-md`) that also contains the "Save UI Logs" button, ensuring consistent layout and styling.

2.  **`electron/renderer.js` Modifications:**
    *   Retrieved the new button element using `const clearUiLogsBtn = document.getElementById('clearUiLogsBtn');`.
    *   Added an event listener to `clearUiLogsBtn`.
    *   Inside the event listener, the following actions are performed upon click:
        *   `logArea.innerHTML = '';`: This clears all content from the log display area.
        *   `logMessage('UI logs cleared.');`: A confirmation message is logged to the (now empty) log area, informing the user that the action was successful.
    *   The `logArea` variable (referencing the log display element) was confirmed to be already defined and accessible within the scope.

## Overall Assessment:
The "Clear Log" button has been successfully implemented, providing users with a convenient way to manage the log display. The changes are consistent with the existing UI structure and JavaScript logic.

---

# Refactor: Remove Web Mode Completion Alert

## Objective:
To enhance user experience by removing the pop-up alert dialog that appears upon successful completion of a web download. The completion information will continue to be available in the log display area.

## Changes Implemented in `electron/renderer.js`:

1.  **Located Target Alert**:
    *   The alert was found within the `setupWebCrawlerEventListeners` function, specifically in the `window.electronAPI.onWebComplete` event handler.

2.  **Removed Alert Call**:
    *   The `alert()` call displaying the web download summary (attempted, successful, failed) was deleted.
    *   The `logMessage()` call, which logs similar summary information to the UI's log area, remains in place.

## User Preference:
*   The user explicitly requested to only remove the completion alert. Alerts for web download errors (`onWebError`) and manual stops (`onWebStopped`) were intentionally kept.

## Overall Assessment:
The web download completion notification is now less intrusive, relying on the log area for feedback. This aligns with similar changes made for local scan notifications, improving consistency in user experience.

---

# Documentation: Update README.md

## Objective:
To comprehensively update the `README.md` file to reflect the current state of the application, including the Electron GUI, its features, installation, usage, and to add visual showcases.

## Changes Implemented in `README.md`:

1.  **Showcase / Demo Section Updated**:
    *   Replaced the placeholder text with actual screenshots of the Electron application:
        *   `./docs/readme_images/image_crawler_light.png` (Light Mode)
        *   `./docs/readme_images/image_crawler_dark.png` (Dark Mode)

2.  **Features Section Expanded**:

    *   Listed key GUI features under this new point, including:
        *   User-friendly interface for Local and Web modes.
        *   Dark/Light theme support (auto-detect, manual toggle).
        *   Integrated log display with save/clear functionality.
        *   UI controls for starting/stopping operations.
        *   Interactive directory selection.
        *   Persistent configuration (settings saved/loaded).
        *   Global default output directory setting.
    *   Minor updates to Web Mode features for clarity (e.g., headless browser option).

3.  **Installation Section Restructured and Updated**:
    *   Clarified that the application is cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).
    *   Renamed "Automatic Installation (Recommended)" to "**For CLI Usage (Global Install)**".
    *   Added a new subsection: "**For Electron GUI Usage (Running from Source/Development)**" with detailed steps:
        *   `git clone https://github.com/rupertgermann/image-crawler.git`
        *   `cd image-crawler`
        *   `npm install`
        *   `npx playwright install --with-deps` (to ensure browsers are available for Electron)
        *   `npm run electron:start` (confirmed from `package.json`)

4.  **Usage Section Updated**:
    *   Added an introductory sentence stating the app can be used via CLI or GUI.
    *   Added a new subsection: "**Electron GUI Mode**" explaining how to launch it (`npm run electron:start`) and briefly describing UI interaction (mode selection, options, start/stop, log area, themes).
    *   Renamed the existing interactive mode section to "**CLI Mode**".

5.  **General Enhancements**:
    *   Updated the "Why Image Crawler?" section to mention both CLI and GUI.
    *   Ensured all existing CLI examples, options, and troubleshooting information were preserved.

## Overall Assessment:
The `README.md` now accurately reflects the project's capabilities, especially highlighting the Electron GUI. The inclusion of screenshots and clear instructions for both CLI and GUI usage significantly improves the documentation's quality and usefulness for new users and developers.

# Progress Update - Added New Providers: StockSnap.io & Shutterstock (Preview) (2025-05-24)

## Implemented Features:
- **New Provider: StockSnap.io (`stocksnap-provider.js`)**:
  - Implemented a provider to fetch free CC0 images from `StockSnap.io` using web scraping.
  - The provider navigates search results and detail pages to extract full-size image URLs.
- **New Provider: Shutterstock (`shutterstock-provider.js`)**:
  - Implemented a provider for `Shutterstock.com`.
  - Primarily uses web scraping to fetch watermarked preview images.
  - Includes a configuration option for an API key (`providers.shutterstock.apiKey`), with a note that full API download functionality is not yet implemented but the structure is ready for future extension. If no key is present, it defaults to preview scraping.
- **Configuration Updates (`config.json`, `config.json.example`)**:
  - Added `stocksnap` and `shutterstock` to the `providers.order` array.
  - Included new configuration sections for `stocksnap` (enabled, maxResults) and `shutterstock` (enabled, maxResults, apiKey placeholder).
- **Documentation Updates (`README.md`)**:
  - Updated the list of supported providers in the "Features" section and the dedicated "Supported Image Providers" section to include `StockSnap.io` and `Shutterstock` (noting its preview capability).
  - Updated the description of the `--provider` CLI option.
  - Corrected and enhanced the example `config.json` structure in the "Advanced Configuration" section to be more comprehensive and include examples for the new providers.

## Encountered Errors:
- The initial update to the example JSON block in `README.md` was overly aggressive and removed some existing examples. This was subsequently corrected.

## How Errors Were Fixed:
- A follow-up `edit_file` operation was performed on `README.md` to restore and enhance the example JSON block, ensuring it accurately reflected a comprehensive configuration including previously existing examples alongside the new ones.

# Progress Update - New Provider Implementation Plan (2025-05-24)

## Implemented Features:
- **Created `docs/new_provider_implementation_plan.md`**:
  - Authored a comprehensive markdown document detailing the plan for implementing new image providers as requested.
  - **Contents of the plan include**:
    - General architectural principles for adding new providers.
    - Strategies for free providers (primarily web scraping).
    - Strategies for commercial providers (API-first approach with web scraping for previews as a fallback).
    - Detailed implementation steps and considerations for a selection of representative providers: 
      - Free: FreeRangeStock.com, PublicDomainPictures.net, Reshot.com.
      - Commercial: Adobe Stock, Getty Images, Dreamstime.
    - Brief notes and considerations for other providers mentioned by the user.
    - Guidelines for updating configuration files (`config.json`, `config.json.example`).
    - Guidelines for updating `README.md`.
    - General testing procedures for new providers.

## Encountered Errors:
- An initial tool call for `write_to_file` was made with an empty JSON object, which was an error in my previous turn. 

## How Errors Were Fixed:
- The error was identified, and the `write_to_file` tool was called again in the subsequent turn with the correct, complete content for `docs/new_provider_implementation_plan.md`.

# Progress Update - Provider Implementation Plan Updated (2025-05-24)

## Implemented Features:
- **Updated `docs/new_provider_implementation_plan.md`**:
  - Replaced the existing Section 4 ("Other Providers (Brief Notes)") with a new, more comprehensive Section 4 titled "Full List of Potential New Providers".

  - This update provides a more complete overview of all potential providers to be considered for future implementation.

## Encountered Errors:
- No new errors encountered in this step.

## How Errors Were Fixed:

# Progress Update - Provider Implementation Task List Created (2025-05-24)

## Implemented Features:
- **Created `docs/provider_implementation_tasks.md`**:
  - Generated a new markdown file containing a comprehensive task list for implementing the new image providers.
  - The task list is based on the `docs/new_provider_implementation_plan.md`.
  - It breaks down the implementation for each pending provider into actionable, checkable steps (e.g., create file, implement constructor, implement `fetchImageUrls`, update config, update README, test).
  - Providers are grouped similarly to the plan (those with detailed plans in Section 3, other API providers, other web scraping providers).
  - This file will serve as a checklist to track progress on implementing the new providers.

## Encountered Errors:
- No errors encountered in this step.

## How Errors Were Fixed:
- N/A.
