# Progress Update - ES Modules Migration and Bug Fixes (2025-05-22)

## Objective:
Converted the entire codebase to use ES modules (import/export) instead of CommonJS (require/module.exports) to modernize the codebase and improve compatibility with newer Node.js features.

## Implemented Features & Changes:

1. **ES Modules Migration:**
   - Added `"type": "module"` to `package.json` to enable ES modules by default
   - Converted all `require()` statements to `import`/`export` syntax throughout the codebase
   - Updated module exports to use named exports and default exports consistently

2. **Provider Loading System Update:**
   - Refactored `provider-registry.js` to use dynamic imports for loading providers
   - Updated all provider files to use ES module exports
   - Implemented proper error handling for async provider loading

3. **Path and Platform Handling:**
   - Ensured all file paths use `import.meta.url` and `fileURLToPath` for proper ES module path resolution
   - Updated platform-specific code to work with ES modules

## Encountered Errors & Solutions:

1. **Module Loading Issues:**
   - **Issue:** `require is not defined` errors when loading providers
   - **Fix:** Replaced all `require()` calls with dynamic `import()` for ES module compatibility

2. **Logger Export Problem:**
   - **Issue:** Logger wasn't properly exporting functions in ES module format
   - **Fix:** Updated logger to use proper ES module exports and fixed imports throughout the codebase

3. **Circular Dependencies:**
   - **Issue:** Some circular dependencies were causing issues with ES modules
   - **Fix:** Restructured imports to avoid circular dependencies where possible

## Next Steps:
- Test the application on different Node.js versions to ensure compatibility
- Consider adding TypeScript for better type safety
- Update documentation to reflect the new ES module requirements

# Progress Update - Recent Cross-Platform Compatibility Analysis

## Objective:
Analyze and ensure the image_crawler application is compatible with macOS and Windows, focusing on path handling and default configurations.

## Implemented Features & Verifications:

1.  **Dynamic Default Paths:**
    *   Ensured `config.json` generation (via `src/utils/config.js`) uses dynamic, user-specific paths for default scan locations:
        *   Windows: `process.env.USERPROFILE + '\\Pictures'` (with fallback to `C:\\Pictures`)
        *   macOS: `$HOME/Pictures`
        *   Linux: `$HOME/Pictures`
    *   Fallbacks in `src/index.js` for source directory selection now consistently use `pathUtils.getDefaultScanDir()`, removing hardcoded `'C:\\\\'` for Windows.
2.  **Code Cleanup:**
    *   Removed the unused `normalizePath` function from `src/utils/platform.js` which had potentially problematic path separator logic.
3.  **Path Handling Best Practices:**
    *   Verified that path construction generally uses `path.join()` and `path.resolve()`, adhering to Node.js best practices for cross-platform path handling.
4.  **OS-Specific Logic Review:**
    *   Confirmed that `os.platform()` and `os.homedir()` (via `getPlatformInfo()`) are used appropriately for platform detection and user-specific directory access.
    *   Native dialog invocation in `src/utils/file-dialog.js` uses correct platform-specific commands (`osascript` for macOS, PowerShell for Windows) with a robust CLI fallback.
5.  **Dependency Review for Cross-Platform:**
    *   `cross-spawn`: Used for platform-independent child processes.
    *   `playwright`: Inherently cross-platform.
    *   `windows-drive-letters`: Handled as an optional dependency with a fallback mechanism for Windows drive detection.

## Encountered Errors & How We Fixed Them:

1.  **Hardcoded Windows User Path in Default Config:**
    *   **Issue:** The `DEFAULT_CONFIG` in `src/utils/config.js` initially used a hardcoded `defaultScanPath: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Pictures'` for Windows.
    *   **Fix:** Modified to use `process.env.USERPROFILE` to construct a dynamic path: `process.env.USERPROFILE ? path.join(process.env.USERPROFILE, 'Pictures') : 'C:\\\\Pictures'`.
2.  **Hardcoded Windows Fallback Path in CLI Logic:**
    *   **Issue:** `src/index.js` contained `'C:\\\\'` as a fallback source directory for Windows in some scenarios.
    *   **Fix:** Replaced these instances with `pathUtils.getDefaultScanDir()` to leverage the centralized and improved default path logic.
3.  **Unused/Potentially Problematic `normalizePath` Function:**
    *   **Issue:** `src/utils/platform.js` included an unused `normalizePath` function that inappropriately forced path separators.
    *   **Fix:** Removed the function to prevent potential future issues and clean up the codebase.

## Overall Assessment:
The application's architecture and use of Node.js core modules (`path`, `os`) and `fs-extra` are well-suited for cross-platform compatibility between macOS and Windows. The primary issues identified were related to hardcoded default paths specific to Windows, which have now been successfully refactored to use dynamic, user-specific locations. Further testing on distinct macOS and Windows environments is recommended to confirm these changes.

# Progress Update - 2025-05-18

## Latest Changes
- Fixed bug where maxDownloads could be 'undefined' or NaN in web mode and logs by ensuring both index.js and PlaywrightCrawler always set a valid number.
- Now, maxDownloads is always a number, using CLI input if valid or falling back to config/default (50).
- Prevents undefined/NaN values in logs and logic, ensuring robust, predictable behavior.

### Implemented Features
- Robust handling and validation of maxDownloads for web crawling mode.
- Defensive programming in both CLI setup and crawler constructor for consistent option passing.

### Encountered Errors
- Crawler and logs sometimes showed 'undefined' or NaN for download limits if the CLI option was omitted or invalid.

### How We Fixed It
- Added logic in index.js to always pass a valid number for maxDownloads to the crawler.
- Updated PlaywrightCrawler constructor to validate and default maxDownloads if needed.
- Confirmed via code review that logs and crawler logic now always use a valid number for this limit.

This update reflects the implementation of the image-crawler-implementation-plan.md, focusing on CLI enhancements, human-readable file size parsing, documentation improvements, and testing setup.

## Provider Refactoring Completed (Session Ending [Timestamp])

**Implemented Features:**
*   All image providers (Pexels, Google, Pixabay, Unsplash, Bing, Flickr, DuckDuckGo, FreeImages, Wikimedia) have been refactored to a new unified interface using `fetchImageUrls` and `getFullSizeImage`.
*   Providers now utilize the `PlaywrightCrawler`'s Playwright page instance instead of managing their own browser instances.
*   Legacy methods (`search`, `getImageUrls`, `downloadImages`) have been removed from all providers.
*   `initialize()` methods and `name` properties were added to all providers for consistency and logging.
*   Provider-specific configurations (e.g., `maxScrollsBing`, `scrollDelayDDG`) were added to `src/utils/config.js` for fine-tuning Bing, DuckDuckGo, and FreeImages behavior.

**Encountered Errors & Fixes:**
*   Initially attempted to use `write_to_file` for `progress.md` which failed as the file exists. Corrected by switching to `edit_file` for appending content (pending this action).

**Next Steps/Outstanding Issues:**
*   Thorough end-to-end testing of all refactored image providers with various search queries and configurations.
*   Update the main `README.md` to reflect any changes in provider configuration or usage, if necessary.
*   General code cleanup and review.
