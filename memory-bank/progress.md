# Progress Update - 2025-05-16

## Latest Changes
- Changed the default folder selection method from native dialogs to CLI interface
- Updated README to document environment variables and their usage
- Made the application more consistent across different environments
- Eliminated potential issues with native dialogs that might not be available in all contexts

## Features Implemented
- Comprehensive automated testing setup using Jest (unit and integration tests)
- Custom test utilities for file system, image generation, and console mocking
- Mocking for fs-extra, fs, and puppeteer to isolate tests
- Coverage enforcement (minimum 70%) and reporting (text, lcov, HTML)
- ESLint and Prettier integration for linting and formatting
- Developer scripts for running all tests, unit/integration tests, and coverage
- Husky/lint-staged pre-commit hook support
- Improved error handling and reporting in both code and documentation
- Expanded documentation on testing strategy and developer workflow
- Added human-readable file size parsing (e.g., '100KB', '1.5MB')
- Enhanced CLI options to match implementation plan exactly
- Updated README with comprehensive usage examples and option descriptions
- Added context7-recommended best practices to implementation plan
- Implemented interactive folder selection for source directories
- Added CLI-based folder selection fallback for when native dialogs don't work
- Enhanced config system to use default output directories

## Errors Encountered and Fixes
- Linting errors in package.json (fixed trailing commas)
- Directory creation errors for test/mocks/utils (resolved by creating directories before file writes)
- Timeout/context deadline errors when editing large test files (mitigated by breaking up edits)
- Fixed undefined output directory error in local mode by:
  - Adding proper validation and fallbacks in the getDefaultDownloadDir function
  - Ensuring the config system always returns valid paths
  - Adding safeguards in the LocalCrawler class to handle undefined directories
  - Implementing detailed logging to help diagnose path resolution issues
- Jest configuration conflicts between package.json and jest.config.js (resolved by using a single config file)
- ES modules compatibility issues with Jest (addressed by updating configuration files)

## How Errors Were Fixed
- Ensured all directories exist before writing files
- Carefully reviewed and applied file edits in smaller chunks when necessary
- Used robust mocking and test utility patterns to isolate and test edge cases
- Renamed configuration files to use appropriate extensions (.cjs) for CommonJS modules
- Updated package.json scripts to explicitly reference the Jest configuration file

This update reflects the implementation of the image-crawler-implementation-plan.md, focusing on CLI enhancements, human-readable file size parsing, documentation improvements, and testing setup.
