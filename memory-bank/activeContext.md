# Active Context - Image Crawler

## Current Work Focus

The Image Crawler project is in a **mature and stable state** following successful completion of the ES Modules migration and cross-platform compatibility improvements. The application is fully functional with comprehensive testing infrastructure and robust error handling.

## Recent Changes & Achievements

### ES Modules Migration (Completed 2025-05-22)
- **Full ES Modules Conversion**: Successfully migrated entire codebase from CommonJS to ES modules
- **Provider System Refactoring**: Updated all 9 image providers to use unified interface with dynamic imports
- **Configuration Modernization**: Enhanced config system to work seamlessly with ES modules
- **Path Resolution Updates**: Implemented proper `import.meta.url` usage throughout

### Cross-Platform Compatibility (Completed 2025-05-20)
- **Dynamic Path Generation**: Eliminated hardcoded Windows paths, now uses environment variables
- **Platform-Specific Optimizations**: Enhanced Windows drive selection and macOS/Linux path handling
- **Robust Fallbacks**: Implemented comprehensive fallback mechanisms for all platform-specific features

### Core Feature Completeness
- **Dual Mode Operation**: Both local scanning and web crawling fully implemented
- **Multi-Provider Support**: 9 web providers integrated (Google, Pixabay, Unsplash, Pexels, Bing, Flickr, DuckDuckGo, FreeImages, Wikimedia)
- **Advanced Filtering**: Size, dimension, file type, and hash-based deduplication
- **Interactive UI**: Native dialogs with CLI fallbacks for all user interactions
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 70%+ coverage with unit and integration tests

## Next Steps & Priorities

### Immediate Actions (If Needed)
1. **Testing Validation**: Ensure Jest configuration works correctly with ES modules
2. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Manual testing on Windows, macOS, and Linux environments
3. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor and optimize memory usage during large operations

### Future Enhancements (Lower Priority)
1. **TypeScript Migration**: Consider adding TypeScript for better type safety
2. **Modern Testing Framework**: Evaluate Vitest as Jest alternative for better ES modules support
3. **Additional Providers**: Expand provider ecosystem based on user feedback
4. **Desktop Application**: Complete Electron wrapper for GUI users

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Architecture
- **ES Modules Commitment**: Fully committed to ES modules, no CommonJS fallbacks
- **Playwright Primary**: Playwright is the primary browser automation tool, Puppeteer being phased out
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Maintain balance between zero-config and power-user customization
- **Cross-Platform First**: All features must work consistently across supported platforms

### User Experience Priorities
- **Progressive Enhancement**: CLI for automation, interactive mode for exploration
- **Graceful Degradation**: Native features with robust CLI fallbacks
- **Clear Feedback**: Comprehensive logging and progress indication
- **Error Recovery**: Intelligent error handling with actionable messages

### Code Quality Standards
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES2022+ features throughout
- **Consistent Patterns**: Unified interfaces and error handling patterns
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Maintain high test coverage with meaningful tests
- **Documentation**: Keep Memory Bank and README synchronized with implementation

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### File Organization
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js              # CLI entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ modes/                # Crawling strategies
â”œâ”€â”€ providers/            # Image source implementations
â””â”€â”€ utils/                # Cross-cutting utilities
```

### Error Handling Philosophy
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Technical errors translated to actionable user guidance
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Always provide alternative when primary method fails
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Debug information available without overwhelming users
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff where appropriate

### Configuration Philosophy
- **Sensible Defaults**: Zero configuration required for basic usage
- **Layered Overrides**: CLI > Environment > File > Defaults
- **Platform Awareness**: Dynamic defaults based on operating system
- **Validation**: Early validation with clear error messages

## Learnings & Project Insights

### ES Modules Migration Insights
- **Dynamic Imports**: Essential for conditional module loading in provider registry
- **Path Resolution**: `import.meta.url` requires careful handling for cross-platform compatibility
- **Testing Challenges**: Jest ES modules support still requires CommonJS config files
- **Dependency Management**: Some dependencies still require CommonJS compatibility layers

### Cross-Platform Development Insights
- **Path Handling**: Never hardcode path separators or assume specific directory structures
- **Environment Variables**: Essential for dynamic default path generation
- **Native Integration**: Platform-specific features need robust CLI fallbacks
- **Testing Complexity**: Cross-platform testing requires multiple environment validation

### User Experience Insights
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity as needed
- **Feedback Loops**: Users need constant feedback during long operations
- **Error Context**: Error messages must include enough context for user action
- **Consistency**: Behavior should be predictable across all modes and platforms

### Provider Integration Insights
- **Unified Interface**: Common interface reduces complexity and improves maintainability
- **Error Isolation**: Provider failures shouldn't affect other providers
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful crawling prevents blocking and maintains access
- **Flexibility**: Provider-specific configurations enable fine-tuning without complexity
